    "# the Big Idea of TablaSet: indexed datasets with projections\n",
    "\n",
    "In physics and engineering, sometimes it seems natural to represent many parameters as elements of some kind of dataset, for example a dict of arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "A TablaSet is a dataset indexed with keys like a dict of TablArrays, but furthered by new principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A TablaSet keeps track of the master shape you would get as a result if you broadcast all elements together.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. New elements cannot be added unless they are broadcast-compatible with all other elements. (Otherwise the maser shape would become undefined.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A client can query a TablaSet using projections, which means that indexing is with respect to the master shape rather than the element shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Projections make degeneracy transparent - you need to know something about the master shape to call for a projected element, but you don't need to know the shape of the element, in other words you don't need to know the element's degeneracy in order to call a projection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Compared to a database\n",
    "\n",
    "If you take together the concepts of indexing and projections, there is application overlap between a TablaSet and a database such as SQL or pandas.DataFrame. TablaSet has differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The broadcast-compatibility of TablaSet makes it a more specific type of database (useful in physics and engineering and similar applications).\n",
    "* Slicing is fundamentally faster than querying.\n",
    "* Databases may be more appropriate if the tabular shapes are fundamentally ragged, which negates the usefulness of slicing anyways.\n",
    "\n",
    "## More docs coming\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm considering some possible significant changes that might make TablaSet easier to work with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* plotting (both TablArray and TablaSet)\n",
    "* make TablaSet's master shape public"
